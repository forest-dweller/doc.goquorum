Tessera can be configured to manage multiple key pairs owned by one tenant. This model is costly to run and scale as more tenants join the network. Use multi-tenancy via multiple private states (MPS) to allow multiple tenants to use the same GoQuorum node, with each tenant having its own private state(s). Each tenant can perform all operations (create, read, and write) on any contract in its private state, and a single tenant can have access to multiple private states . Multi-tenancy provides a user experience similar to a user running their own managed node. The public state remains publicly available to all tenants, and private states are logically separated. Architecture \u00b6 In this example architecture, an organization represents a tenant with multiple departments, and users within the departments. Each tenant operates on its own private state. Each user in an organization owns one or more privacy manager key pairs that allow them to operate on their organization\u2019s private state. A network operator administers entitlements and private state access for each organization using the authorization server. JSON-RPC security features are used to manage a user\u2019s access to a private state. The authorization server controls this access. Network topology \u00b6 A network can consist of multi-tenant nodes and single-tenant nodes. One or more independent authorization servers can be used to protect multi-tenant nodes, but one multi-tenant node can only be protected by one authorization server. Enterprise authorization server \u00b6 To support multi-tenancy, you must configure an authorization server, such as ORY Hydra or Okta . The authorization server can grant private state access to clients via a private state identifier (PSI) . Access token scope \u00b6 The JSON-RPC security plugin enables the geth JSON-RPC API server to be an OAuth2-compliant resource server. A client must first obtain a pre-authenticated access token from an authorization server, then present the access token (using an Authorization HTTP request header) when calling an API. Calls to the GoQuorum API without an authenticated token are rejected. The value of the scope encoded in an access token (in case of JWT), or Introspection response (in the case of the OAuth2 Token Introspection API) contains the RPC scope and tenant scope, which has the following URL-based syntax: \"psi://[PSI]?self.eoa=0x0&node.eoa=0x0\" In the syntax, PSI is the URL-encoded value of the PSI. For example, for a client that has access to two private states PS1 and PS2 , an authorization server operator sets up and grants the following scopes to the client: \"psi://PS1?self.eoa=0x0&node.eoa\" \"psi://PS2?self.eoa=0x0&node.eoa\" A client presenting an access token containing these scopes has full access (read/write/create) to private contracts on private states PS1 and PS2 using any Ethereum accounts. Multiple private states \u00b6 Multiple private states (MPS) is a feature that allows a GoQuorum node to manage more than one private state. This functionality lays the foundation for multi-tenancy. If running GoQuorum version 21.4.1 or earlier or Tessera version 21.1.1 or earlier, upgrade your existing nodes to enable MPS . Private state identifier \u00b6 A private state is identified by a sequence of bytes, referred to as the PSI (private state identifier). The PSI is used to determine the specific private state a user can operate on. Trie of private states \u00b6 A trie of private states keeps track of all private states managed by a node. The PSI is the key in the trie that maps to the root hash of the corresponding private state. At each block: All affected private states are updated and their new root hashes are calculated. The trie is updated with the new private state root hashes at their PSIs. A new root of the trie of private states is calculated and mapped to the public block hash. Private state manager \u00b6 The GoQuorum private state manager resolves the PSI based on input parameters. Any RPC API call must be accompanied by a PSI or authorization token. From the token, the private state manager derives the private state the user is attempting to access. Tessera resident groups \u00b6 MPS uses Tessera resident groups to map tenants to private states. During Tessera startup, residentGroups are validated to check each Tessera key is part of a single resident group. Every Tessera key must be in a resident group for Tessera to start. During GoQuorum startup, the residentGroups are retrieved from Tessera and kept in memory in GoQuorum. Tessera Q2T communication changes \u00b6 The /groups/resident QT2 endpoint returns the resident groups defined in Tessera. This endpoint is invoked at GoQuorum startup to retrieve all resident groups. These details are kept in memory in GoQuorum, so the private state manager can resolve these resident groups to the corresponding private state. Accessing a private state \u00b6 Users must specify the private state they wish to operate on. For backwards compatibility, if a user connects without specifying the private state, the default private identifier is used. If a private state is not configured, the user operates on an empty read-only private state. In order of precedence, users have the following three options to specify a private state to operate on: URL parameter. PSI query parameter can be added to the API URI: geth attach http://localhost:22000/?PSI = PS1 HTTP header.

Activities. Ensure consortium members are known to every participant in the network. Ensure private and public payload data is compliant with privacy policies. GoQuorum node \u00b6 The GoQuorum client is an Ethereum client that uses a transaction manager to encrypt and decrypt private transaction payloads. GoQuorum and its dependencies use the TCP/UDP transport layer to communicate. GoQuorum\u2019s security depends on the security of the client host, transaction manager host, encryption keys, consensus runtime, and network access controls. Host security checklist \u00b6 Harden the GoQuorum host operating system following industry best practices (for example, remove irrelevant services and root access). Disable direct remote network access to the GoQuorum host management interface in production. Use a host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS) to monitor the GoQuorum node host. Enable host-based firewall rules that limit network access to the JSON-RPC interface to only pre-identified, trusted, and required systems. Implement a robust patch management program, and always keep the host updated to the latest stable version. Ensure host-level isolation of responsibility between the GoQuorum client and its dependencies (for example, don\u2019t run the transaction manager and its database in the same host). Run GoQuorum network hosts with service level agreements (SLAs) that defend against non-vulnerability-based denial of service. Client security checklist \u00b6 Encrypt all communications to and from the JSON-RPC interface using TLS to prevent data leakage and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. Enable an enterprise JSON-RPC authorization model to enforce atomic access controls to ledger module functionalities (for example, personal.OpenWallet ). Implement a robust patch management program, and always keep the client updated to latest stable version. Don\u2019t start the GoQuorum client run configuration with unlocked accounts. Configure cross-domain access to the JSON-RPC interface appropriately. Set peer discovery based on the consortium requirements. In Raft consensus, there\u2019s no guarantee a leader isn\u2019t acting maliciously, so don\u2019t use Raft in an environment where the network ledger is managed by third-party authorities. Run GoQuorum with metrics collection enabled to preserve operational security. User security checklist \u00b6 Ensure accounts\u2019 private-key-encrypted passwords are never stored in the ledger host in any form. In an architecture where accounts\u2019 private keys are not offloaded to ledger node clients, regularly back up the encrypted private keys. Monitoring \u00b6 The GoQuorum network produces logs that should be monitored for security anomalies. Security checklist \u00b6 Log all activities of GoQuorum hosts to a centralized log system. Ensure the centralized log system can answer queries about: Ethereum accounts on the network. Active ledger and transaction manager nodes in the network. Public and private transaction rates per account in the network. Number of public smart contracts in the network. Network connections to ledger nodes and metadata. Consensus protocol metadata (for example, block creation rate and source). Back up and verify logs. Implement an alerting system to monitor consensus protocol anomalies. Transaction manager \u00b6 Tessera is GoQuorum\u2019s transaction manager. GoQuorum privacy features depend on Tessera to encrypt, decrypt, and broadcast the orchestrations of private transaction payloads. Tessera encryption keys are the most critical element of the privacy model; if they\u2019re compromised, the network loses its privacy. Tessera supports integration with trusted platform modules (TPMs) and hardware security modules (HSM) to reduce surface attacks and provide a secure environment. Security checklist \u00b6 Run Tessera in an independent network segment in production. Use certificate-based mutual authentication (mTLS) with Tessera\u2019s dependencies. Store encryption keys in secure environments such an HSM. Ensure the secret storage services support key rotation. Depending on the deployment model, back up encryption keys in offline secured locations. Ensure the secret storage service is in complete isolation of the external network. Don\u2019t store Tessera connection strings in plaintext in configuration files. When deploying secret storage in the cloud, use a single tenancy model. Enable host firewall rules to limit inbound and outbound traffic to only consumers of vault services. This includes essential host services like DNS and NTP. Limit remote access to the secret storage instance to only allowlisted IP addresses, and enable MFA. Disable remote root access to Tessera/secret storage hosts.

Blockchain participants run a blockchain client, such as GoQuorum, and connect it to the network as a node . Consensus \u00b6 To ensure that transactions are written to the chain, and that there is agreement on the data and state of the network, blockchains use a consensus mechanism that is a fault-tolerant. Consensus mechanisms include: Proof of Work (PoW) - PoW is a consensus mechanism used in Bitcoin that is both time- and computation-intensive. PoW blocks are created by nodes called miners . Proof of Authority (PoA) - PoA involves a set of trusted nodes that validate transactions and create blocks. These trusted nodes are called validators , and other nodes in the network are called non-validating nodes . Non-validating nodes still validate the blocks that the validators create, but they don\u2019t produce them. GoQuorum supports the PoA algorithms IBFT, QBFT, Raft, and Clique. Smart contracts \u00b6 Smart contracts provide controlled access and a range of functions (such as querying, transacting, and updating state) to blockchain users. Smart contracts encapsulate data and keep it consistent across the network. They can allow or restrict participants from executing certain functions, and can restrict access to the network itself. Smart contracts are written in Solidity (the most popular smart contract language), Vyper, and Serpent. Dapps \u00b6 Decentralized applications (dapps) are just like any other software application can be on a website or mobile app. Dapps are built on a decentralized network (Ethereum) and interact with smart contracts deployed to the network. They can be thought of as a GUI (front end) for a smart contract (back end), and can be written in any language (for example, JavaScript). Permissioning \u00b6 Permissioning involves a distributed network of trust across a blockchain network, in which participants agree to follow certain rules. If one bad actor doesn\u2019t follow the rules other nodes can restrict the bad actor from writing to the blockchain. GoQuorum has support for node permissioning and account permissioning, allowing only specific nodes and accounts to\\ access the network. Privacy \u00b6 In a blockchain network, privacy refers to the ability to keep transactions private between the involved participants. Often in a consortium network, some of the participants prefer to restrict how much information they share or who they transact with. In other cases, this may not be a concern at all. GoQuorum supports privacy using a private transaction manager (PTM) paired to your member node, typically Tessera . Tessera uses an enclave for cryptographic functionality and stores and allows access to encrypted transaction data, and exchanges encrypted payloads with other Tessera nodes. Tessera is restful/stateless and can be load balanced easily. Forks \u00b6 Forks are splits in the blockchain network, or mechanisms to add functionality ( EIPs ) to the blockchain protocol from a community-agreed-upon block. Hard forks are radical changes to the network that may change the validity of a block (or a certain chain of blocks). Hard forks require all nodes to upgrade to the latest version of the client. These are permanent deviations from the main chain.","title":"Components"},{"location":"concepts/blockchain-basics/blockchain-components/#blockchain-components","text":"","title":"Blockchain components"},{"location":"concepts/blockchain-basics/blockchain-components/#nodes","text":"Blockchains are decentralized, which means that they store data across a network of members who collaborate to monitor and run the network.

Blockchains are decentralized, which means that they store data across a network of members who collaborate to monitor and run the network. The system as such cannot be owned a single entity, but rather by everyone on the network. The block in blockchain refers to a block of transactions that has been broadcast to the network. The chain refers to a string of these blocks in chronological order. When a new block of transactions is securely validated by the network, it is attached to the end of an existing chain. This chain of blocks is an ever-growing ledger of transactions, each of which can be traced, providing accountability and transparency unavailable on traditional ledgers. What problems do blockchains solve? \u00b6 We live in a highly transactional world, where we must constantly trust one another with sensitive data, transactions, and records. Most of our interactions on the Internet run on centralized web servers (for example, banks) and massive amounts of user data often exist in a single database. This poses a few risks, as current databases are designed to be controlled by trusted administrators who can read, alter, block, or delete data. In addition, the centralized architecture of the Internet today is vulnerable to censorship and targeted attacks by both hackers and internal bad actors. The value of a blockchain is the certainty of the network: participants can establish a trusted and immutable record of transactions without the need for intermediaries. The decentralized architecture of a blockchain\u2014a global network of computers simultaneously running the software and validating the chain of transactions\u2014is what ensures that the transaction record is never compromised. It makes a blockchain network less likely to fail and harder to attack. Why do I need a blockchain for my business? \u00b6 Blockchains introduce a new model of doing business, where networks have standard methods for transactions, data storage, and establishing identities of all participants. Blockchains foster trust between participants, with decentralization and improved security. Participants\u2019 privacy concerns are addressed by anonymizing data and requiring permissions to limit access. Transaction visibility enables businesses to track the origins of an asset accurately, and maintain inventory and quality of goods. The biggest benefit of blockchains is the opportunities that arise for businesses to grow and collaborate. Multiple organizations can come together to create a consortium network working towards a shared goal, where terms and permissions are agreed upon and deployed to the blockchain. These policies can evolve over time, updating through participant-based governance. Blockchains can help make your business smoother and more efficient, allowing you to focus on growing your business.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"concepts/blockchain-basics/what-is-blockchain/#blockchain-introduction","text":"","title":"Blockchain introduction"},{"location":"concepts/blockchain-basics/what-is-blockchain/#what-is-a-blockchain","text":"A blockchain is a shared, immutable electronic ledger (or digital database) that keeps a record of transactional data.

PoA consensus protocols work when participants know each other and there is a level of trust between them (for example, in a permissioned consortium network). PoA consensus protocols have faster block times and a much greater transaction throughput than the Ethash Proof of Work consensus protocol used on Ethereum Mainnet. In the GoQuorum PoA consensus protocols, a group of nodes in the network act as validators (IBFT and QBFT), verifiers (Raft) or signers (Clique). Existing validators, verifiers, or signers vote to add or remove network nodes. Note For the rest of this page, the term \u201cvalidator\u201d is used to refer to validators, verifiers, and signers. Properties \u00b6 Properties to consider when comparing the PoA consensus protocols are: Immediate finality. Minimum number of validators. Liveness. Speed. Immediate finality \u00b6 QBFT and Raft have immediate finality. When using QBFT and Raft there are no forks and all valid blocks get included in the main chain. IBFT and Clique do not have immediate finality. Implementations using IBFT and Clique must be aware of forks and chain reorganizations occurring. Minimum number of validators \u00b6 To be Byzantine fault tolerant, IBFT and QBFT require a minimum of four validators. Byzantine fault tolerance is the ability to function correctly and reach consensus despite nodes failing or propagating incorrect information to peers. Raft and Clique can operate with a single validator but operating with a single validator offers no redundancy if the validator fails. Liveness \u00b6 Raft and Clique are more fault tolerant than IBFT and QBFT. Raft and Clique tolerate up to half of the validators failing. Important While Clique is Byzantine fault tolerant, Raft is only crash fault tolerant because the Raft leader is assumed to always act correctly. IBFT and QBFT networks require greater than or equal to two-thirds of validators to be operating to create blocks. For example, a QBFT network of: Four to five validators tolerates one unresponsive validator. Six to eight validators tolerates two unresponsive validators. Networks with three or fewer validators can produce blocks but do not guarantee finality when operating in adversarial environments. Important We do not recommend using IBFT and QBFT networks with three nodes for production purposes. Speed \u00b6 Reaching consensus and adding blocks is fastest in Raft networks, then in Clique networks. For Clique, the probability of a fork increases as the number of validators increases.

For example, a private contract is deployed between nodes 1 and 2. Without counter-party protection, if node 3 discovers the private contract address, it can send a transaction with privateFor set to node 2. The transaction isn\u2019t applied to node 3\u2019s private state because node 3 isn\u2019t a participant in the private transaction, but the transaction is applied to node 2\u2019s private state. To enable counter-party protection, enable enhanced privacy and set privacyFlag to 1 when using send API methods . Mandatory party protection \u00b6 Mandatory party protection inherits all features of counter-party protection, and also allows you to define one or more recipients as mandatory for a private contract. The mandatory recipient is included in all subsequent transactions to the contract and has full private state, while normal recipients may only have partial state of the contract. Use mandatory party protection if you need governing or central nodes to have full private state for any contracts deployed in the network. To enable mandatory party protection, enable enhanced privacy and set privacyFlag to 2 and the mandatoryFor parameter to a list of mandatory recipients when using send API methods . Private state validation \u00b6 Private state validation prevents state divergence by ensuring that any private transaction for the contract is always sent to all participants. For example, a private contract is deployed between nodes 1 and 2. Without private state validation, node 1 can send a transaction to the private contract with a privateFor of [] . The transaction changes the private state of node 1 but not node 2, and the private states of 1 and 2 no longer match. With private state validation, a transaction from node 1 with a privateFor of [] is rejected and the transaction is processed only when privateFor contains both 1 and 2. Private state validation shares the full participant list among all participants, and validates against all subsequent transactions. Transactions sent to a subset of participants fail. In standard privacy or when only using counter-party protection , only the sender knows the full participant list. To enable private state validation, enable enhanced privacy and set privacyFlag to 3 when using send API methods . Using privacy enhancements \u00b6 Limitations \u00b6 Depending on the complexity of the contracts and the throughput of the network, the state at simulation time may differ from the chain state at the time the proposed transaction is published. If the state at publishing time is changed from simulation time, the corresponding PP , MPP , and PSV transactions fail on all participants. Furthermore, since state divergence is expected in PP and MPP contracts, it\u2019s possible (depending on contract design) for PP and MPP transactions to fail on some participants. Concurrency may also present a problem for PSV contracts. The execution hash calculation is based on the chain state at simulation time. Submitting multiple transactions to the same PSV contract from multiple nodes concurrently may result in most of the transactions failing. Important Because of these limitations, use privacy-enhanced transactions only when the enhanced privacy is necessary and the extra privacy benefits outweigh the potential shortfalls. Transaction interactions \u00b6 No interactions are allowed between the different types of private transactions. The only allowed interaction is for private contracts ( SP , PP , MPP , and PSV ) to read from public contracts. The privacy enhancements feature only performs its checks on published transactions. None of the limitations apply to calls (read only transactions); calls are contract method invocations executed locally and don\u2019t result in published transactions. Enabling privacy enhancements \u00b6 To enable privacy enhancements in Tessera, set the enablePrivacyEnhancements parameter in the Tessera configuration file to true . To enable privacy enhancements in GoQuorum, set the privacyEnhancementsBlock in the GoQuorum genesis file config object to a future block, when the entire network is ready to transact with privacy-enhanced transactions. All GoQuorum nodes in the network must be initialized with the same privacyEnhancementsBlock value. You can disable enablePrivacyEnhancements in the Tessera configuration if your GoQuorum node is not ready to support privacy enhancements. This allows the GoQuorum node to reject PP , MPP , and PSV transactions from other nodes until the node is ready to support privacy-enhanced transactions. Backward compatibility \u00b6 An upgraded GoQuorum node can coexist on a network where other nodes are running earlier GoQuorum versions. However, it can\u2019t support privacy-enhanced contracts until all interested nodes are upgraded and enable privacy. Important If an upgraded but non-privacy-enabled GoQuorum node receives a PP , MPP , or PSV transaction, the node logs a BAD BLOCK error. If the consensus algorithm is Raft, the node stops. If the consensus algorithm is IBFT or QBFT, the node keeps trying to add the bad block, and reprints the errors. It won\u2019t catch up with rest of nodes until restarted and reinitialized with the correct privacyEnhancementsBlock . If you set the enablePrivacyEnhancements flag to true in Tessera without enabling privacy in GoQuorum, the node can crash, as the Tessera node accepts PP , MPP , and PSV transactions. An upgraded Tessera node can continue to communicate with Tessera nodes running on previous versions using SP transactions.","title":"Privacy enhancements"},{"location":"concepts/privacy/privacy-enhancements/#privacy-enhancements","text":"In addition to standard privacy ( SP ) , GoQuorum provides three kinds of privacy enhancements: Counter-party protection ( PP ) Mandatory party protection ( MPP ) Private state validation ( PSV )","title":"Privacy enhancements"},{"location":"concepts/privacy/privacy-enhancements/#counter-party-protection","text":"Counter-party protection prevents non-participants from interacting with a private contract, without using access controls.

Storing encrypted private data off-chain in a separate component called the private transaction manager . The private transaction manager encrypts private data, distributes the encrypted data to other parties that are privy to the transaction, and returns the decrypted payload to those parties. Replacing the payload of a private transaction with a key for the location of the encrypted payload, such that the original payload isn\u2019t visible to participants who aren\u2019t privy to the transaction. Note While GoQuorum introduces the notion of \u201cpublic transactions\u201d and \u201cprivate transactions,\u201d it does not introduce new transaction types. Rather, it extends the Ethereum transaction model to include an optional privateFor parameter (the inclusion of which results in GoQuorum treating a transaction as private) and the transaction type has a new IsPrivate method to identify private transactions. Public transactions \u00b6 Public transactions have payloads that are visible to all participants of the same network. These are created as standard Ethereum transactions . Examples of public transactions include market data updates from a service provider, or a reference data update such as a correction to a bond security definition. Note GoQuorum public transactions are not transactions from the public Ethereum network. Perhaps a more appropriate term would be \u201ccommon\u201d or \u201cglobal\u201d transactions, but \u201cpublic\u201d is used to contrast with \u201cprivate\u201d transactions. Private transactions \u00b6 Private transactions have payloads that are visible only to the network participants whose public keys are specified in the privateFor parameter of the transaction. privateFor can take multiple addresses in a comma-separated list. When a GoQuorum node encounters a transaction with a non-null privateFor value, it sets the v value of the transaction signature to 37 or 38 (as opposed to public transactions, whose v values are set according to EIP-155 ). Notes privateFor is not shared with other participants; it\u2019s only used to identify which nodes to send the encrypted payload to. There\u2019s no direct restriction on private transaction size. As with public transactions, the only restriction is the gas limit. See the private transaction high-level lifecycle . You can enable private transactions by configuring the private transaction manager connection , and you can send private transactions . Public vs. private transaction handling \u00b6 Public transactions are executed in the standard Ethereum way. If a public transaction is sent to an account that holds contract code, each participant executes the same code, and their state databases are updated accordingly. Private transactions are executed differently: before the sender\u2019s GoQuorum node propagates the transaction to the rest of the network, the node substitutes the original transaction payload with a key for the location of the encrypted payload received from Tessera. Participants privy to the transaction can replace the hash with the original payload via their Tessera instance, while participants not privy only see the hash. If a private transaction is sent to an account that holds contract code, participants not privy to the transaction skip the transaction and don\u2019t execute the contract code. Participants privy to the transaction replace the hash and call the virtual machine for execution, and their state databases update accordingly. Note See the private transaction high-level lifecycle for an illustrated example. As a result, these two sets of participants end up with different state databases and can\u2019t reach consensus. To support this forking of contract state, GoQuorum stores the state of public contracts in a public state trie that is globally synchronized, and the state of private contracts in a private state trie not globally synchronized. State verification \u00b6 Block validation includes a check on the root of the public state trie to determine if the public state is synchronized across nodes. It also includes a check the global transaction hash, which is a hash of all public and private transactions in a block. This means that each node can validate that it has the same set of transactions as other nodes. Synchronization of the public state root and private transaction inputs (through the global transaction hash) can imply synchronization of the private state across participating nodes. To further validate that the private state change from a private transaction is the same across all participants, use eth_storageRoot specifying the private smart contract address and block height. If the state is in sync across all participating nodes, they return the same root hash. Limitations \u00b6 This model imposes a restriction on the ability to change public state in private transactions. Since a common use case for a private contract is to read data from a public contract, the virtual machine changes to read only mode for each call from a private contract to a public contract. If the virtual machine is in read only mode, and the code tries to make a state change, the virtual machine stops execution and throws an exception.","title":"Public and private transactions"},{"location":"concepts/privacy/private-and-public/#public-and-private-transactions","text":"GoQuorum achieves transaction privacy by: Enabling transaction senders to create private transactions by marking who is privy to a transaction via the privateFor parameter.

To allow for continuity in the event of failure, configure two or more bootnodes. We recommend putting bootnodes on the network itself and not behind a load balancer because the enode URL relates to the node public key, IP address, and discovery ports. Any changes to a bootnode enode prevents other nodes from being able to establish a connection with the bootnode. To ensure that a bootnode enode does not change when recovering from a complete bootnode failure: Create the node key pair (the private and public key) before starting the bootnode. When creating bootnodes in the cloud (for example, AWS or Azure), attempt to assign a static private IP address to them, and record this IP address. We recommend that you store the bootnode configuration under source control.

In public blockchains such as Ethereum Mainnet, new nodes continuously join and talk to the existing network. In permissioned blockchains, this may not happen as often, but it\u2019s still an important task to achieve as your network evolves. When adding new nodes to the network, it\u2019s important to understand that the GoQuorum network and Tessera network are distinct and do not overlap in any way. Therefore, options applicable to one are not applicable to the other. In some cases, they may have their own options to achieve similar tasks, but must be specified separately. Prerequisites \u00b6 GoQuorum installed Tessera A running network Adding GoQuorum nodes \u00b6 Raft \u00b6 Use the following API methods on an existing node to add, remove, and promote nodes in a Raft network: raft_addPeer to add a verifier node raft_addLearner to add a learner node raft_promoteToPeer to promote a learner to a verifier raft_removePeer to remove a node If you are using permissioning or peer-to-peer discovery, see the extra options . After addPeer or addLearner : Initialize the new node with the network\u2019s genesis configuration: geth --datadir <NEW-NODE-DATA-DIRECTORY> init <GENESIS-FILE> Note Where you get the genesis file is dependent on the network. You may get it from an existing peer, a network operator, or somewhere else. Start the new GoQuorum node with the --raftjoinexisting and --raft command line options. Use the Raft ID returned by addPeer or addLearner as the argument for --raftjoinexisting . Example PRIVATE_CONFIG = ignore geth --datadir qdata/dd7 ... OTHER ARGS ... --raft --raftport 50407 --http.port 22006 --port 21006 --raftjoinexisting 7 The new node is now up and running, and will start syncing the blockchain from existing peers. Once this has completed, it can send new transactions just as any other peer. Important For a Raft network to work, 51% of the peers must be up and running. We recommend having an odd number of at least 3 peers in a network. IBFT, QBFT, and Clique \u00b6 Adding a non-validator node to an IBFT , QBFT , or Clique network is simpler than adding a node to a Raft network, as it only needs to configure itself rather than be pre-allocated on the network (permissioning aside). Initialize the new node with the network\u2019s genesis configuration: geth --datadir <NEW-NODE-DATA-DIRECTORY> init <GENESIS-FILE> Note Where you get the genesis file is dependent on the network. You may get it from an existing peer, a network operator, or somewhere else. If you are using permissioning or peer-to-peer discovery, see the extra options . Start the new node, pointing either to a bootnode or listing an existing peer in the static-nodes.json file. Once a connection is established, the node will start syncing the blockchain, after which transactions can be sent. Adding a validator to an IBFT or QBFT network requires using the consensus APIs outlined in the IBFT tutorial and the QBFT tutorial . Info Validator nodes require the --mine command line option on startup, which enables mining, while non-validator nodes do not. Extra options \u00b6 Some options take effect regardless of the consensus mechanism used. Permissioned nodes \u00b6 If you have permissioning configured using the permissioned-nodes.json file, make sure this file is updated on all nodes before the new node is able to communicate with existing nodes. You don\u2019t need to restart any nodes for the changes to take effect. Static node connections \u00b6 If not using peer-to-peer node discovery (for example, you specify --nodiscover ), then the node only makes connections to peers defined in the static-nodes.json file. When adding a new node, configure static peers in its static-nodes.json file. The more peers defined here, the better the network connectivity and fault tolerance. Note You don\u2019t need to update the existing peers\u2019 static nodes for the connection to be established, although it is good practice to do so. You don\u2019t need to specify every peer in your static nodes file if you do not wish to connect to every peer directly. Peer-to-peer discovery \u00b6 If using discovery, more options in addition to static nodes become available. Any nodes connected to your peers, which at the start are your static peers , are discoverable by you; you connect to these nodes automatically. You may specify bootnodes using the --bootnodes parameter. This takes a comma-separated list of enode URLs, similar to the static-nodes.json file. These act in the same way as static nodes, letting you connect to them and find out about other peers, who you then connect to. Note If you have discovery disabled, you won\u2019t try to find other nodes to connect to, but others can still find and connect to you. Adding Tessera nodes \u00b6 Add a new Tessera node by ensuring you have one of the existing nodes listed in your Tessera peer list. Peer configuration example { \"peers\" : [ { \"url\" : \"http://existingpeer1.com:8080\" } ] } From there, Tessera connects to that peer and discovers and connects to all the other Tessera nodes in the network. Note You may want to include multiple peers in the peer list in case any of them are offline/unreachable. IP allowlisting \u00b6 Tessera IP allowlisting (whitelisting) restricts connections in a way similar to using permissioned-nodes.json in GoQuorum. If allowlisting is configured , only IP addresses/hostnames in your Tessera peer list can connect to you. To add a new Tessera node with allowlisting enabled: Add the new peer to each of the existing nodes. You can run the following command without restarting an already running node: java -jar tessera.jar admin -configfile /path/to/existing-node-config.json -addpeer http://newpeer.com:8080 Start the new peer, setting the peers configuration to mirror the existing network. Peers configuration example { \"peers\" : [ { \"url\" : \"http://existingpeer1.com:8080\" }, { \"url\" : \"http://existingpeer2.com:8080\" }, { \"url\" : \"http://existingpeer3.com:8080\" } ] } The new node now allows incoming connections from the existing peers, and existing peers allow incoming connections from the new peer. Discovery \u00b6 You can disable Tessera discovery to have Tessera only allow keys that are owned by a node in its peer list to be available to the users. This means that if Tessera finds any keys owned by a node not in its peer list, those keys are discarded and private transactions cannot be sent to that public key. Notes This does not affect incoming transactions. Someone not in your peer list can still send transactions to your node, unless you also enable the IP allowlist option. IP allowlisting blocks communications between nodes, whereas disabling discovery only affects which public keys Tessera keeps track of. To add a new Tessera node with discovery disabled: Add the new peer to each of the existing nodes. You can run the following command without restarting an already running node: java -jar tessera.jar admin -configfile /path/to/existing-node-config.json -addpeer http://newpeer.com:8080 Start the new peer, setting the peers configuration to mirror the existing network. Peers configuration example { \"peers\" : [ { \"url\" : \"http://existingpeer1.com:8080\" }, { \"url\" : \"http://existingpeer2.com:8080\" }, { \"url\" : \"http://existingpeer3.com:8080\" } ] } The new node now records public keys belonging to the existing peers, and existing peers record public keys belonging to the new peer.

Revoking suspension of an organization \u00b6 To revoke the suspension of an organization, use quorumPermission_updateOrgStatus with action set to 2. Example \u00b6 Revoke the suspension of ORG1 with the following command: geth console request quorumPermission . updateOrgStatus ( \"ORG1\" , 2 , { from : \"0xed9d02e382b34818e88b88a309c7fe71e65f419d\" }) geth console result \"Action completed successfully\" Revoking an organization\u2019s suspension requires majority approval using quorumPermission_approveOrgStatus with action set to 2: geth console request quorumPermission . approveOrgStatus ( \"ORG1\" , 2 , { from : \"0xed9d02e382b34818e88b88a309c7fe71e65f419d\" }) geth console result \"Action completed successfully\" View the organization\u2019s updated status in the organization list: geth console request quorumPermission . orgList [ 0 ] geth console result { full OrgId : \"ORG1.SUB1\" , level : 2 , orgId : \"SUB1\" , pare nt OrgId : \"ORG1\" , s tatus : 2 , subOrgLis t : null , ul t ima te Pare nt : \"ORG1\" } Once the revoke is approved, all accounts in the organization and sub-organizations under it are able to transact as per role level access. Assigning admin privileges at organization and network level \u00b6 At times, an account at the organization level may need be able to perform network admin activities. Also, there may be a need to change the admin account at organization level. Both of these activities can be performed by existing network admin accounts only, and will require majority approval from the network admin accounts. Example \u00b6 To assign a network admin or organization admin role to an account, use quorumPermission_assignAdminRole : geth console request quorumPermission . assignAdminRole ( \"ORG1\" , \"0x0638e1574728b6d862dd5d3a3e0942c3be47d996\" , \"ADMIN\" , { from : \"0xed9d02e382b34818e88b88a309c7fe71e65f419d\" }) geth console result \"Action completed successfully\" View the account\u2019s updated role in the account list: geth console request quorumPermission . acctList [ 3 ] geth console result { acc t Id : \"0x0638e1574728b6d862dd5d3a3e0942c3be47d996\" , isOrgAdmi n : true , orgId : \"ORG1\" , roleId : \"ADMIN\" , s tatus : 1 } To approve the assignment of a network admin role, use quorumPermission_approveAdminRole : geth console request quorumPermission . approveAdminRole ( \"ORG1\" , \"0x0638e1574728b6d862dd5d3a3e0942c3be47d996\" , { from : eth . accounts [ 0 ]}) geth console result \"Action completed successfully\" View the account\u2019s updated status in the account list: geth console request quorumPermission . acctList [ 4 ] geth console result { acc t Id : \"0x0638e1574728b6d862dd5d3a3e0942c3be47d996\" , isOrgAdmi n : true , orgId : \"ORG1\" , roleId : \"ADMIN\" , s tatus : 2 } The account can now perform all activities allowable by a network admin account and can participate in the approval process for any actions at network level.","title":"Enhanced permissions"},{"location":"configure-and-manage/manage/enhanced-permissions/#using-enhanced-permissioning","text":"Managing the enhanced permissioning model can be broadly categorized into the following activities:","title":"Using enhanced permissioning"},{"location":"configure-and-manage/manage/enhanced-permissions/#setting-up-the-initial-network","text":"Please refer to the configuration instructions for detailed information.

The official implementation enables the GoQuorum client to protect JSON-RPC APIs using the following features: Native Transport Layer Security \u00b6 Native Transport Layer Security (TLS) introduces an encryption layer to the JSON-RPC request/response communication channel for both HTTP and WebSocket listeners. By using a simple configuration flag, this feature allows the automatic generation of a self-signed certificates for testing environments, or a smooth integration with certificate authorities for enterprise deployment. Enterprise authorization protocol integration \u00b6 Enterprise authorization protocol integration introduces an access control layer that authorizes each JSON-RPC invocation to an atomic module function level (for example personal_OpenWallet ) using the industry standard OAuth 2.0 protocol and JSON Web Token (JWT) method. This feature enables GoQuorum access control and dapp management. Configuration \u00b6 Refer to the plugin implementation for more details and find examples on how to configure the plugin to work with different OAuth2 Authorization servers . Client usage \u00b6 Before invoking protected JSON-RPC APIs, the client must request an access token by authenticating with the authorization server. An access token can be opaque or a JWT. It\u2019s the client\u2019s responsibility to maintain this token\u2019s validity during its lifetime. When invoking a JSON-RPC API, the client must send the token in the Authorization request header field with the Bearer authentication scheme.

On Node B or C, obtain Node A\u2019s Raft ID (GoQuorum Raft node ID in the network): geth console request raft.cluster JSON result { \"jsonrpc\" : \"2.0\" , \"id\" : 10 , \"result\" : [{ \"raftId\" : 1 , \"nodeId\" : \"<enodeId>\" , ... }, ...] } In this example Node A\u2019s Raft ID is 1. On Node B or C, remove Node A from the network using its Raft ID: raft.removePeer ( <RAFT-ID> ) Update the network configuration in Node A\u2019s static-nodes.json file. Note Even if this file isn\u2019t specified with --raftjoinexisting , it should be updated to keep in sync with the current cluster configuration. Add Node A back to the Raft network with its new network configuration. The nodes can now connect with their peers, and raft.cluster shows the updated information and network configuration. Peers need a new networking configuration \u00b6 In this scenario, the migrated node must update the IP addresses and ports of its peers. For example, Nodes A, B, and C are in the same private sub-network, and Node A migrates to another sub-network, or to the internet. NAT is used to translate the IP addresses from the public to private sub-network and vice versa, requiring the nodes to use their peers\u2019 public IPs. This requires updating the configuration of Node A to use the public IP addresses of Nodes B and C, and updating the configurations of Nodes B and C to use the public IP address of Node A. Steps \u00b6 Stop all nodes. Clean the cached Raft data. In the data folder of each node, run: rm quorum-raft-state raft-* This forces Raft to refresh the cluster state based on the latest information in the static-nodes.json without losing any of the blockchain data. Migrate Node A\u2019s data to the new location. Update the network configuration in the static-nodes.json file of each node with its peers\u2019 accessible IP addresses and ports. Start all nodes.

Configure multi-tenancy via multiple private states \u00b6 Prerequisites \u00b6 Tessera version 21.4.0 or later installed GoQuorum version 21.4.2 or later installed Important If running an earlier GoQuorum or Tessera version, upgrade your existing nodes to enable MPS and multi-tenancy using the migration guide . Steps \u00b6 Set isMPS to true in the config item of the GoQuorum genesis file . MPS configuration { \"config\" : { ... \"isMPS\" : true }, ... } Note There can be a mix of MPS-enabled and non-MPS-enabled nodes in a network. Configure the JSON-RPC security plugin . This requires configuring an authorization server. View examples of configuring the plugin to work with different OAuth2 authorization servers . Set enableMultiplePrivateStates to true in the Tessera configuration file. The default is false . Important GoQuorum can\u2019t start if isMPS is true in the GoQuorum configuration and enableMultiplePrivateStates is false in the Tessera configuration. GoQuorum runs as a non-MPS-enabled node if isMPS is false and enableMultiplePrivateStates is true . Configure residentGroups in the Tessera configuration file. Run GoQuorum with the --multitenancy command line option. geth [ OPTIONS ] --multitenancy --plugins file:///<path>/<to>/plugins.json In the command, plugins.json is the plugin settings file that contains the JSON-RPC Security plugin definition . For example, if you use quorum-security-plugin-enterprise , plugins.json looks like the following: plugins.json { \"providers\" : { \"security\" : { \"name\" : \"quorum-security-plugin-enterprise\" , \"version\" : \"0.1.1\" , \"config\" : \"/path/to/config.json\" } } } Configure custom scopes \u00b6 A network operator must configure scope values for each user in an authorization server, for each tenant. Example \u00b6 This example network contains four nodes. Multi-tenant Node1 is shared between tenant J and G ( isMPS=true ) and single-tenant Node2 is used by tenant D alone ( isMPS=false ). Note A node consists of a GoQuorum client and Tessera private transaction manager. We name privacy manager key pairs for easy referencing, for example: J_K1 or G_K1 . In reality, their values are the pubic keys used in the privateFor and privateFrom fields. Tenants are assigned to multi-tenant nodes as follows: J Organization owns J_K1 and J_K2 , and its tenancy is on Node1 . G Organization owns G_K1 and G_K2 , and its tenancy is on Node1 . D Organization owns D_K1 , and its tenancy is on Node2 . In practice, J Organization and G Organization may decide to allocate keys to their departments, therefore the security model may be as follows: J Organization : J Investment has access to J tenancy using any self-managed Ethereum accounts. J Settlement has access to J tenancy using node-managed Ethereum account J_ACC1 and a self-managed Wallet1 . G Organization : G Investment has access to G tenancy using any self-managed Ethereum accounts. G Settlement has access to G tenancy using node-managed Ethereum account G_ACC1 and self-managed Wallet2 . Each authorization server has its own configuration steps and client onboarding process. A network operator\u2019s responsibility is to implement this security model in the authorization server by defining custom scopes and granting them to target clients.

You can also pass in extra configuration such as a KeyVault name. The repository also contains Azure ARM templates and AWS eksctl templates to deploy the required base infrastructure. Limitations \u00b6 Kubernetes has a limitation when using multi-clusters in that its load balancers disallow TCP and UDP traffic on the same port. This inhibits discovery working natively for each pod. Use the following solutions to mitigate this: Disallow discovery and use static nodes to allow only TCP traffic.

If you need to use discovery, use something like CNI which is supported by all major cloud providers, and the cloud templates already have CNI implemented. CNI \u00b6 With the traditional Kubelet networking mode, nodes get an IP from the virtual network subnet. Each node in turn uses NAT to configure the pods so that they reach other pods on the virtual network. This limits where they can reach but also more specifically what can reach them, for example an external VM which has to have custom routes does not scale well. CNI on the other hand allows every pod to get a unique IP directly from the virtual subnet which removes the above restriction. It therefore has a limit on the maximum number of pods that can be spun up, so you need to plan ahead to avoid IP exhaustion. Multi-cluster \u00b6 You need to enable CNI to use multi-cluster, or to connect external nodes to an existing Kubernetes cluster. To connect multiple clusters, they must each have different CIDR blocks to ensure no conflicts, and the first step is to peer the VPCs or VNets together and update the route tables. From that point on you can use static nodes and pods to communicate across the cluster.

Note geth 1.9.7 has several enhancements at the database layer which are part of GoQuorum 2.6.0. Hence, once migrates to 2.6.0, it cannot rollback to older version of Quorum. The recommendation is to keep the back of the data directory before upgrading to 2.6.0 which can be used to revert back to older version if necessary. A node running on GoQuorum 2.6.0 can coexist on a network where other nodes are running on lower version of GoQuorum and thus supports node by node upgrade to GoQuorum 2.6.0. The suggested upgrade process is as described below: Bring down the node which needs to be upgraded to GoQuorum 2.6.0. Modify the genesis.json file to include istanbulBlock and petersburgBlock . The values for this should be set to an appropriate value in future by when the entire network would have upgraded to GoQuorum 2.6.0. This is important as the gas calculation logic has changed in geth 1.9.7. Not setting this value properly can result in Bad block error GoQuorum 2.6.0 has deprecated genesis attributes maxCodeSize and maxCodeSizeChangeBlock . To allow tracking of multiple maxCodeSize value changes, a new attribute maxCodeSizeConfig is added to genesis. If the maxCodeSize was changed multiple times, it could result in Bad block error for any new node joining the network. The changes in GoQuorum 2.6.0 address this and enable tracking of historical changes of maxCodeSize in genesis and thus allow it to be changed multiple times in network life. With this change when init is executed in GoQuorum 2.6.0, geth will force usage of maxCodeSizeConfig .

The location for freezerdb can be provided by the geth command line option: --datadir.ancient <value> - Data directory for ancient chain segments (default = inside chaindata ) When a node is migrated to this version, geth by default will create the ancient data folder and start moving blocks below the immutability threshold (default: 3162240) into the ancient data. If you do not want this movement to happen, use --immutabilitythreshold to set the immutability threshold to an appropriate value when starting geth . geth 1.9.7 by default does not allow keystore-based accounts to be unlocked in the startup process. geth will crash if the unlock is attempted as a part of startup. To enable account unlocking, use --allow-insecure-unlock : --allow-insecure-unlock - Allow insecure account unlocking when account-related RPCs are exposed by http. Failure to sync up - GoQuorum 2.6.0 can fail to sync up with missing parent error under the following scenario: In a GoQuorum network running with gcmode=full and block height exceeding immutability threshold (with blocks in freezerdb), if a node is restarted non-gracefully ( kill -9/docker kill & start ) then it can fail to sync up with its peers with missing parent error. This is due to an upstream bug where non-graceful restart causes gap between leveldb and freezerdb.

We recommend reading the go-plugin gRPC examples . Some advanced topics not available in the go-plugin documentation are covered in this page. Lifecycle \u00b6 Each plugin starts as a separate process and communicates with the GoQuorum client host process via the gRPC service interfaces, over a mutual TLS connection on the local machine. The implementation is inside the go-plugin library. Developing plugins in Go is simplest. For plugins written in other languages , plugin authors must understand the following lifecycle: geth looks for the plugin distribution file after reading the plugin definition from settings. geth verifies the plugin distribution file integrity. geth generates a self-signed certificate (client certificate). geth spawns the plugin with the client certificate. The plugin imports the client certificate and generates a self-signed server certificate for its RPC server. The plugin includes the RPC server certificate in the handshake. geth imports the plugin RPC server certificate. geth communicates with the plugin via RPC over TLS, using mutual TLS. Each plugin must implement the PluginInitializer gRPC service interface . After the plugin process starts and establishes a connection with the GoQuorum client, GoQuorum invokes the Init() gRPC method to initialize the plugin with data from the plugin configuration file, detailed below. Configure plugins \u00b6 GoQuorum can load plugins from: A JSON file specified using the --plugins command line option. An Ethereum TOML configuration file specified using the --config command line option. Configuration files \u00b6 You can specify the plugin configuration file with the following content.

Smart contracts \u00b6 Smart contracts provide controlled access and a range of functions (such as querying, transacting, and updating state) to blockchain users. Smart contracts encapsulate data and keep it consistent across the network. They can allow or restrict participants from executing certain functions, and can restrict access to the network itself. Smart contracts are written in Solidity (the most popular smart contract language), Vyper, and Serpent. Smart contracts work on the general conditional principle (if/then) of programming, written into code on the blockchain. When conditions defined in the contract are met and verified, it is submitted as a transaction onto the chain where a network of peers validate and execute it. When the transaction is complete, the chain is then updated and its new state is immutable, meaning that you cannot change the state once it is written to the chain. Transactions can be public or private. The contents of a puublic transaction are visible to all participants on the blockchain network, and the contents of private transactions can only be seen by parties of the transaction, or those that have been granted access to view it.

When conditions defined in the contract are met and verified, it is submitted as a transaction onto the chain where a network of peers validate and execute it. When the transaction is complete, the chain is then updated and its new state is immutable, meaning that you cannot change the state once it is written to the chain. Transactions can be public or private. The contents of a puublic transaction are visible to all participants on the blockchain network, and the contents of private transactions can only be seen by parties of the transaction, or those that have been granted access to view it. Typically transactions are used to deploy contracts , interact with contracts or transfer funds and the links provide tutorials of each.","title":"Smart contracts"},{"location":"develop/smart-contracts-transactions/#dapps","text":"Decentralized applications (dapps), like any other software application, can be a website or mobile app. Dapps are built on a decentralized network (Ethereum) and interact with smart contracts deployed to the network.

Note Gas price is removed from GoQuorum networks , so is not included as a transaction object parameter in GoQuorum privacy methods. When using standard Ethereum JSON-RPC methods such as sendSignedTransaction , set gasPrice to 0. eth_distributePrivateTransaction \u00b6 Send a signed private transaction to the local private transaction manager and share with private participant\u2019s transaction managers. This API method is to be used as part of the process for sending externally signed privacy marker transactions . The private transaction should be signed, sent to participants with this API, and the resulting hash set as the PMT\u2019s data .

More details \u00b6 Impossible reorganisation (reorg) issue \u00b6 Impossible reorganisation issues can occur if there was an issue during sync. Possible causes are: Node was not cleanly shutdown previously, causing database corruption An edge case where two sealers generate blocks at the exact same time (depends on consensus type in use) Insufficient resources (disk or memory) Some (unknown) issue during resync The action to be taken will depend on the cause. Note that more recent versions of GoQuorum may already include fixes to prevent some of these issues. In the event of database corruption, see instructions below for Resolution of database corruption issues . Bad block issue \u00b6 This can occur if there was an issue when inserting a new block into the chain and is logged in the form: ########## BAD BLOCK ######### Chain config: %v Number: %v Hash: 0x%x 'transaction receipt' Error: %v ############################## The error detail gives more information as to the root cause. Here are a few possibilities and suggested actions: \"invalid gas used\" : This occurs if the local node calculates a different gas usage for transactions than the node which created the block. This may be due to a configuration issue. \"insufficient balance to pay for gas\" : This is similar to \"invalid gas used\" , but occurs when there is insufficient gas to complete a transaction. \"invalid merkle root\" : Cause is usually a corrupted database or failed import. See instructions under the section on Resolution of database corruption issues . \"unknown ancestor\" : This is usually due to an issue with fast sync. Restarting the node may resolve it. \"blacklisted hash\" : The cause and resolution of this is like the \"Found bad hash, rewinding chain\" error. Note that more recent versions of GoQuorum may already include fixes to prevent some of these issues. Resolution of database corruption issues \u00b6 Corruption of the database (chain data) can occur due to lack of resources, or after a \u2018forced\u2019 shutdown. Sometimes, GoQuorum will recover automatically or require a restart of the failing node. If the node does not recover then it may require the chaindata to be deleted and resynced. The chain data can be removed by shutting down the node and running geth removedb --datadir /path/to/data/directory .

Use the Quorum Developer Quickstart to rapidly generate a local blockchain network. Prerequisites \u00b6 A network with a deployed smart contract as in the deploying smart contracts tutorial . Interact with public contracts \u00b6 This tutorial uses the SimpleStorage.sol contract: pragma solidity ^ 0.7.0 ; contract SimpleStorage { uint public storedData ; constructor ( uint initVal ) public { storedData = initVal ; } function set ( uint x ) public { storedData = x ; } function get () view public returns ( uint retVal ) { return storedData ; } } Once the contract is deployed, you can perform a read operation using the get function call and a write operation using the set function call. This tutorial uses the web3js library to interact with the contract. The Quorum Developer Quickstart provides a full example of a public contract script . 1. Perform a read operation \u00b6 To perform a read operation, you need the address that the contract was deployed to and the contract\u2019s ABI. The contract\u2019s ABI can be obtained from compiling the contract; see the deploying smart contracts tutorial for an example. Use the web3.eth.Contract object to create a new instance of the smart contract, then make the get function call from the contract\u2019s list of methods, which will return the value stored: async function getValueAtAddress ( host , deployedContractAbi , deployedContractAddress ){ const web3 = new Web3 ( host ); const contractInstance = new web3 . eth . Contract ( deployedContractAbi , deployedContractAddress ); const res = await contractInstance . methods . get (). call (); console . log ( \"Obtained value at deployed contract is: \" + res ); return res } 2. Perform a write operation \u00b6 To perform a write operation, send a transaction to update the stored value. As with the get call , you need to use the address that the contract was deployed to and the contract\u2019s ABI. The account address must correspond to an actual account with some ETH in it to perform the transaction. Make the set call passing in your account address, value as the updated value of the contract, and the amount of gas you are willing to spend for the transaction: // You need to use the accountAddress details provided to GoQuorum to send/interact with contracts async function setValueAtAddress ( host , accountAddress , value , deployedContractAbi , deployedContractAddress ){ const web3 = new Web3 ( host ); const contractInstance = new web3 . eth . Contract ( deployedContractAbi , deployedContractAddress ); const res = await contractInstance . methods . set ( value ). send ({ from : accountAddress , gasPrice : \"0x0\" , gasLimit : \"0x24A22\" }); return res } 3. Verify an updated value \u00b6 To verify that a value has been updated, perform a get call after a set update call. Interact with private contracts \u00b6 This private contracts example uses the same SimpleStorage.sol contract as in the public contracts example , but it uses the eth_sendRawPrivateTransaction method to interact with the contract. Both read and write operations are performed using the eea_sendRawTransaction API call. The Quorum Developer quickstart provides a full example of a private contract script . 1. Perform a read operation \u00b6 Performing a read operation on a contract is identical to the public contract example , and you need the address that the contract was deployed to and the contract\u2019s ABI. Use the web3.eth.Contract object to create a new instance of the smart contract, then make the get function call from the contract\u2019s list of methods, which will return the value stored: async function getValueAtAddress ( host , deployedContractAbi , deployedContractAddress ){ const web3 = new Web3 ( host ); const contractInstance = new web3 . eth . Contract ( deployedContractAbi , deployedContractAddress ); const res = await contractInstance . methods . get (). call (); console . log ( \"Obtained value at deployed contract is: \" + res ); return res } 2. Perform a write operation \u00b6 Performing a write operation is almost the same process as the read operation, except that you encode the new value to the set function\u2019s ABI, and then append these arguments to the set function\u2019s ABI and use this as the data field. Additionally provide the public key of the Transaction Manager of the respective node. async function setValueAtAddress ( host , value , deployedContractAbi , deployedContractAddress , fromAddress , toPublicKey ) { const web3 = new Web3 ( host ) const contractInstance = new web3 . eth . Contract ( deployedContractAbi , deployedContractAddress ); const res = await contractInstance . methods . set ( value ). send ({ from : fromAddress , privateFor : [ toPublicKey ], gasLimit : \"0x24A22\" }); return res } 3.

Use the Quorum Developer Quickstart to rapidly generate a local blockchain network. Prerequisites \u00b6 A private network if deploying a public contract. A privacy-enabled network if deploying a private contract (public contracts can also be deployed on privacy-enabled networks). Note You can use the Quorum Developer Quickstart to deploy either public contracts or private contracts. To enable privacy, enter Y at the prompt for private transactions. Compile the contract \u00b6 You first need to create a smart contract. The following examples use the SimpleStorage.sol smart contract. Create a new file called compile.js with the following content: compile.js const fs = require ( 'fs' ). promises ; const solc = require ( 'solc' ); async function main () { // Load the contract source code const sourceCode = await fs . readFile ( 'SimpleStorage.sol' , 'utf8' ); // Compile the source code and retrieve the ABI and bytecode const { abi , bytecode } = compile ( sourceCode , 'SimpleStorage' ); // Store the ABI and bytecode into a JSON file const artifact = JSON . stringify ({ abi , bytecode }, null , 2 ); await fs . writeFile ( 'SimpleStorage.json' , artifact ); } function compile ( sourceCode , contractName ) { // Create the Solidity Compiler Standard Input and Output JSON const input = { language : 'Solidity' , sources : { main : { content : sourceCode } }, settings : { outputSelection : { '*' : { '*' : [ 'abi' , 'evm.bytecode' ] } } }, }; // Parse the compiler output to retrieve the ABI and bytecode const output = solc . compile ( JSON . stringify ( input )); const artifact = JSON . parse ( output ). contracts . main [ contractName ]; return { abi : artifact . abi , bytecode : artifact . evm . bytecode . object , }; } main (). then (() => process . exit ( 0 )); Run the compile code to get the smart contract\u2019s output JSON: node compile.js Run solc to get the contract\u2019s bytecode and ABI: solc SimpleStorage.sol --bin --abi Once you have the bytecode and ABI, you can rename the output files to make them easier to use. This tutorial refers to them as SimpleStorage.bin and SimpleStorage.abi . You can now deploy this contract to a network as a public or private transaction. Public contracts \u00b6 1. Using eth_sendTransaction \u00b6 Call eth_sendTransaction with the following parameters: from - Address of the sender\u2019s account. to - Address of the receiver. To deploy a contract, set to null . gas - Amount of gas provided by the sender for the transaction. gasPrice - Price for each unit of gas the sender is willing to pay. Set to zero in GoQuorum networks. data - One of the following: For contract deployments (this use case), the compiled binary of the contract . For contract interactions, the hash of the invoked method signature and encoded parameters (see Ethereum Contract ABI ). For simple ether transfers, empty.

Using web3.eth.Contract \u00b6 Using the outputs from compiling the contract , create a new file public_tx_web3.js (or run the following commands in a JavaScript console) to send the transaction. The example code uses the Developer Quickstart and sends the transaction from Member1. public_tx_web3.js const path = require ( 'path' ); const fs = require ( 'fs-extra' ); const web3 = new Web3 ( host ); // use the existing Member1 account address or make a new account const address = \"f0e2db6c8dc6c681bb5d6ad121a107f300e9b2b5\" ; // read in the contracts const contractJsonPath = path . resolve ( __dirname , 'SimpleStorage.json' ); const contractJson = JSON . parse ( fs . readFileSync ( contractJsonPath )); const contractAbi = contractJson . abi ; const contractByteCode = contractJson . evm . bytecode . object async function createContract ( host , contractAbi , contractByteCode , contractInit , fromAddress ) { const web3 = new Web3 ( host ) const contractInstance = new web3 . eth .

Once the contract object is created, you give it the JSON interface of the smart contract and the library converts the calls into low level ABI calls over RPC for you. This benefits you as a developer as it allows you to interact with smart contracts as if they were JavaScript objects. 3. Using eth_sendSignedTransaction \u00b6 To deploy a smart contract using eth_sendSignedTransaction , use an account\u2019s private key to sign and serialize the transaction, and send the API request. This example uses the web3js library to make the API calls and the outputs from compiling the contract . Create a new file public_tx.js (or run the following commands in a JavaScript console) to send the transaction. public_tx.js const web3 = new Web3 ( \"http://localhost:20000\" ); // use an existing account or make a new account const privateKey = \"b9a4bd1539c15bcc83fa9078fe89200b6e9e802ae992f13cd83c853f16e8bed4\" ; const account = web3 . eth . accounts . privateKeyToAccount ( privateKey ); // read in the contracts const contractJsonPath = path . resolve ( __dirname , 'SimpleStorage.json' ); const contractJson = JSON . parse ( fs . readFileSync ( contractJsonPath )); const contractAbi = contractJson . abi ; const contractBinPath = path . resolve ( __dirname , 'SimpleStorage.bin' ); const contractBin = fs . readFileSync ( contractBinPath ); // initialize the default constructor with a value `47 = 0x2F`; this value is appended to the bytecode const contractConstructorInit = \"000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002F\" ; // get txnCount for the nonce value const txnCount = await web3 . eth . getTransactionCount ( account . address ); const rawTxOptions = { nonce : web3 . utils . numberToHex ( txnCount ), from : account . address , to : null , // public tx value : \"0x00\" , data : '0x' + contractBin + contractInit , // contract binary appended with initialization value gasPrice : \"0x0\" , // Set to 0 in GoQuorum networks gasLimit : \"0x24A22\" // max number of gas units the tx is allowed to use }; console . log ( \"Creating transaction...\" ); const tx = new Tx ( rawTxOptions ); console . log ( \"Signing transaction...\" ); tx . sign ( privateKey ); console . log ( \"Sending transaction...\" ); var serializedTx = tx . serialize (); const txr = await web3 . eth . sendSignedTransaction ( '0x' + serializedTx . toString ( 'hex' ). toString ( \"hex\" )); console . log ( \"tx transactionHash: \" + txr . transactionHash ); console . log ( \"tx contractAddress: \" + txr . contractAddress ); rawTxOptions contains the following fields: nonce - Number of transactions sent from this address. from - Address of the EthSigner account. to - Address of the receiver. To deploy a contract, set to null . gas - Amount of gas provided by the sender for the transaction. gasPrice - Price for each unit of gas. Set to zero in GoQuorum networks. data - Binary of the contract (in this example there\u2019s also a constructor initialization value appended to the binary value). value - Amount of ETH in Wei transferred from the sender to the recipient. As the example demonstrates, once the transaction tx is created, you can sign it with the private key of the account. You can then serialize it and call eth_sendSignedTransaction to deploy the contract. For reference, the Developer Quickstart provides an example of a public transaction script . Private contracts \u00b6 1. Using eth_sendTransaction \u00b6 Call eth_sendTransaction with the following parameters: from - Address of the sender\u2019s account. to - Address of the receiver. To deploy a contract, set to null . gas - Amount of gas provided by the sender for the transaction. gasPrice - Price for each unit of gas. Set to zero in GoQuorum networks. privateFrom - The sender\u2019s base-64-encoded public key. privateFor - Array of the recipient\u2019s base-64-encoded public keys. privacyFlag - 0 for standard private, 1 for counter party protection . and 3 for private state validation . data - One of the following: For contract deployments (this use case), the compiled binary of the contract . For contract interactions, the hash of the invoked method signature and encoded parameters (see Ethereum Contract ABI ). For simple ether transfers, empty.

This benefits you as a developer as it allows you to interact with smart contracts as if they were JavaScript objects.","title":"2.

This tutorial walks you through creating an QBFT private network with five nodes. Warning QBFT is currently an early access feature. It is not recommended for production networks with business critical impact. Important The steps in this tutorial create an isolated, but not protected or secure, Ethereum private network. We recommend running the private network behind a properly configured firewall. Prerequisites \u00b6 GoQuorum . Ensure that PATH contains geth and bootnode . Tip GoQuorum is a fork of geth . GoQuorum uses the geth command to start GoQuorum nodes. Steps \u00b6 1. Install Istanbul tools \u00b6 The istanbul-tools repository contains tools for configuring QBFT networks. git clone https://github.com/ConsenSys/istanbul-tools.git cd istanbul-tools make qbft 2. Create directories \u00b6 Create directories for your private network and five nodes.

Important This tutorial runs a private network suitable for education or demonstration purposes and is not intended for running production networks. Prerequisites \u00b6 Node.js and NPM version 14 or higher Docker and Docker-compose Truffle development framework curl command line MetaMask Important Allow Docker up to 4G of memory or 6G if running the privacy examples. Refer to the Resources section in Docker for Mac and Docker Desktop for details. Generate the tutorial blockchain configuration files \u00b6 To create the tutorial docker-compose files and artifacts, run: npx quorum-dev-quickstart Follow the prompts displayed to run GoQuorum and logging with ELK . Enter n for Codefi Orchestrate and y for private transactions . Start the network \u00b6 To start the network, go to the installation directory ( quorum-test-network if you used the default value) and run: ./run.sh The script builds the Docker images, and runs the Docker containers. Four GoQuorum IBFT validator nodes and a non-validator node are created to simulate a base network. In addition, there are three member pairs (GoQuorum and Tessera sets) to simulate private nodes on the network. When execution is successfully finished, the process lists the available services: Services list ************************************* Quorum Dev Quickstart ************************************* ---------------------------------- List endpoints and services ---------------------------------- JSON-RPC HTTP service endpoint : http://localhost:8545 JSON-RPC WebSocket service endpoint : ws://localhost:8546 Web block explorer address : http://localhost:25000/ Prometheus address : http://localhost:9090/graph Cakeshop toolkit address : http://localhost:8999 Grafana address : http://localhost:3000/d/a1lVy7ycin9Yv/goquorum-overview?orgId=1&refresh=10s&from=now-30m&to=now&var-system=All For more information on the endpoints and services, refer to README.md in the installation directory. **************************************************************** Use the JSON-RPC HTTP service endpoint to access the RPC node service from your dapp or from cryptocurrency wallets such as MetaMask. Use the JSON-RPC WebSocket service endpoint to access the WebSocket node service from your dapp. Use the Web block explorer address to display the block explorer web application. Use the Prometheus address to access the Prometheus dashboard and monitor nodes and view metrics . Use the Grafana address to access the Grafana dashboard to monitor nodes and view metrics . Use the Kibana logs address to access and manage logs in Kibana . To display the list of endpoints again, run: ./list.sh Use a block explorer \u00b6 The quickstart supports a modified version of the Alethio Ethereum Lite Explorer and BlockScout . Alethio Ethereum Lite Explorer \u00b6 Access the Alethio Ethereum Lite Explorer at http://localhost:25000 as displayed when starting the private network. The block explorer displays a summary of the private network, indicating four peers. Click the block number to the right of Best Block to display the block details: You can explore blocks by clicking on the blocks under Bk on the left-hand side. You can search for a specific block, transaction hash, or address by clicking the in the top left-hand corner. BlockScout \u00b6 At the prompt Do you wish to enable support for monitoring your network with BlockScout? , enter Y to start BlockScout at http://localhost:26000 . Note BlockScout\u2019s Docker image is resource heavy when running. Ensure you have adequate CPU resources dedicated to the container. The quickstart BlockScout configuration is available as a reference for your own network. Monitor nodes with Prometheus and Grafana \u00b6 The sample network also includes Prometheus and Grafana monitoring tools to let you visualize node health and usage. You can directly access these tools from your browser at the addresses displayed in the endpoint list. Prometheus dashboard . Grafana dashboard . For more details on how to configure and use these tools for your own nodes, see our performances monitoring documentation , the Prometheus documentation and Grafana documentation . Run JSON-RPC requests \u00b6 You can run JSON-RPC requests on: HTTP with http://localhost:8545 . WebSockets with ws://localhost:8546 . Run with curl \u00b6 This tutorial uses curl to send JSON-RPC requests over HTTP. Request the node version \u00b6 Run the following command from the host shell: curl -X POST --data '{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"method\":\"web3_clientVersion\",\"params\":[],\"id\":1}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://localhost:8545 The result displays the client version of the running node: Result example { \"jsonrpc\" : \"2.0\" , \"id\" : 1 , \"result\" : \"Geth/node5-istanbul/v1.9.20-stable-1d7926a1(quorum-v21.4.2)/linux-amd64/go1.15.5\" } Result explanation \"jsonrpc\" : \"2.0\" indicates that the JSON-RPC 2.0 spec format is used. \"id\" : 1 is the request identifier used to match the request and the response. This tutorial always uses 1. \"result\" contains the running GoQuorum information: v1.9.20-stable-1d7926a1 is the Geth build that has been used for GoQuorum quorum-v21.4.2 is the running GoQuorum version number. This may be different when you run this tutorial. linux-amd64 is the architecture used to build this version. go1.15.5 is the Go version used. This may be different when you run this tutorial. Successfully calling this method shows that you can connect to the nodes using JSON-RPC over HTTP. From here, you can walk through more interesting requests demonstrated in the rest of this section, or skip ahead to Create a transaction using MetaMask . Count the peers \u00b6 Peers are the other nodes connected to the node receiving the JSON-RPC request. Poll the peer count using net_peerCount : curl -X POST --data '{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"method\":\"net_peerCount\",\"params\":[],\"id\":1}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://localhost:8545 The result indicates seven peers (our validators): { \"jsonrpc\" : \"2.0\" , \"id\" : 1 , \"result\" : \"0x7\" } Request the most recent block number \u00b6 Call eth_blockNumber to retrieve the number of the most recently synchronized block: curl -X POST --data '{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"method\":\"eth_blockNumber\",\"params\":[],\"id\":1}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://localhost:8545 The result indicates the highest block number synchronized on this node. { \"jsonrpc\" : \"2.0\" , \"id\" : 1 , \"result\" : \"0x2a\" } Here the hexadecimal value 0x2a translates to decimal as 42 , the number of blocks received by the node so far, about two minutes after the new network started. Private transactions \u00b6 This example uses the web3.js library to make the API calls, creating three member nodes pairs (a GoQuorum node which has a corresponding Tessera node for privacy) that can be accessed using APIs on the following ports: Member1Quorum RPC: http://localhost:20000 Member1Tessera: http://localhost:9081 Member2Quorum RPC: http://localhost:20002 Member1Tessera: http://localhost:9082 Member3Quorum RPC: http://localhost:20004 Member1Tessera: http://localhost:9083 Navigate to the smart_contracts directory and deploy the private transaction: cd smart_contracts npm install node scripts/private_tx.js This deploys the contract and sends an arbitrary value ( 47 ) from Member1 to Member3 . Once done, it performs a read operation on the contract using the get function and the contract\u2019s ABI, at the address specified. It then performs a write operation using the set function and the contract\u2019s ABI, at the address and sets the value to 123 . Lastly, it performs a read operation on all three members to verify that this is private between Member1 and Member3 only, and you should see that only Member1 and Member3 return the result of 123 , and Member2 has an undefined value. node scripts/private_tx.js The transaction hash is: 0x4d796b2ccac109fc54006105df44c519341696fa88e004ce5c614239cb9f92a2 Address of transaction: 0x695Baaf717370fcBb42aB45CD83C531C27D79eF1 Use the smart contracts 'get' function to read the contract 's constructor initialized value .. Member1 obtained value at deployed contract is: 47 Use the smart contracts ' set ' function to update that value to 123 .. - from member1 to member3 Verify the private transaction is private by reading the value from all three members .. Member1 obtained value at deployed contract is: 123 Member3 obtained value at deployed contract is: 123 Member2 obtained value at deployed contract is: undefined Inspect the member nodes with geth attach \u00b6 You can inspect any of the GoQuorum nodes by using attach.sh to open the geth JavaScript console. Use a separate terminal window for each of Member1, Member2, and Member3. In each terminal, go to the main directory where docker-compose.yml is located, then: In terminal 1, run ./attach.sh 1 to attach to Member1. In terminal 2, run ./attach.sh 2 to attach to Member2. In terminal 3, run ./attach.sh 3 to attach to Member3. To view the private transaction, run the following command in one of the terminals: geth console request eth . getTransaction ( \"0x4d796b2ccac109fc54006105df44c519341696fa88e004ce5c614239cb9f92a2\" ); // replace with your transaction hash JSON result { blockHash : \"0x3d69d2eb2a50a96072c549805f0ba04ce364b68ef7c16cd0ddac8e6c184e599e\" , blockNumber : 823 , fr om : \"0xf0e2db6c8dc6c681bb5d6ad121a107f300e9b2b5\" , gas : 150050 , gasPrice : 0 , hash : \"0x4d796b2ccac109fc54006105df44c519341696fa88e004ce5c614239cb9f92a2\" , i n pu t : \"0xe619b9d1469c34735145be181a28d18c09b575ef1a8fdbdcb0fe3934c2de5a8c62814e93b087ee918cfa294a0023aa6d42ef360ccf4997f1b94ae1e6c9145a3a\" , n o n ce : 6 , r : \"0x2660131d78ccd80773e8094d9fbf7d030f9753ddb1496af5b12f643ba95f900b\" , s : \"0x50f3e787595b88e5738adba373971d61394c9710d1a0dbee7287d10085d2fef5\" , t o : null , transa c t io n I n dex : 0 , v : \"0x26\" , value : 0 } Note The v field value of \"0x25\" or \"0x26\" (37 or 38 in decimal) indicates this transaction has a private payload (input). Read the contract with get() \u00b6 For each of the three nodes, create a variable called address using the geth console, and assign to it the address of the contract created by Member1. The contract address can be found: In Member1\u2019s log file data/logs/1.log . Using eth.getTransactionReceipt(txHash) , where txHash is the hash printed to the terminal after sending the transaction. The contract address is found in the result parameter contractAddress . It is also printed in the terminal when the private transaction is processed. After identifying the contract address, run the following command in each terminal: var address = \"0x695Baaf717370fcBb42aB45CD83C531C27D79eF1\" ; // replace with your contract address Use eth.contract to define a contract class with the simpleStorage ABI definition in each terminal: var address = \"0x695baaf717370fcbb42ab45cd83c531c27d79ef1\" // replace with your address var abi = [{ \"constant\" : true , \"inputs\" : [], \"name\" : \"storedData\" , \"outputs\" : [{ \"name\" : \"\" , \"type\" : \"uint256\" }], \"payable\" : false , \"type\" : \"function\" },{ \"constant\" : false , \"inputs\" : [{ \"name\" : \"x\" , \"type\" : \"uint256\" }], \"name\" : \"set\" , \"outputs\" : [], \"payable\" : false , \"type\" : \"function\" },{ \"constant\" : true , \"inputs\" : [], \"name\" : \"get\" , \"outputs\" : [{ \"name\" : \"retVal\" , \"type\" : \"uint256\" }], \"payable\" : false , \"type\" : \"function\" },{ \"inputs\" : [{ \"name\" : \"initVal\" , \"type\" : \"uint256\" }], \"type\" : \"constructor\" }]; var private = eth . contract ( abi ). at ( address ) The function calls are available on the contract instance, and you can call those methods on the contract. Get the value of the contract to confirm that only Member1 and Member3 can see the value. In terminal window 1 (Member1): private . get () 123 In terminal window 2 (Member2): private . get () undefined In terminal window 3 (Member3): private . get () 123 Member2 can\u2019t read the state. Look in smart_contracts/node scripts/private_tx.js to confirm that 123 was the value set when the contract was updated. Write to the contract with set() \u00b6 Have Member1 set the state to the value 200 and confirm that only Member1 and Member3 can view the new state. In terminal window 1 (Member1): # send to Member3 private . set ( 200 ,{ from : eth . accounts [ 0 ], privateFor : [ \"1iTZde/ndBHvzhcl7V68x44Vx7pl8nwx9LqnM/AfJUg=\" ]}); \"0xacf293b491cccd1b99d0cfb08464a68791cc7b5bc14a9b6e4ff44b46889a8f70\" You can check the log files in data/logs/ to see each node validating the block with this new private transaction. Once the block containing the transaction is validated, you can check the state from each of the members. In terminal window 1 (Member1): private . get () 200 In terminal window 2 (Member2): private . get () undefined In terminal window 3 (Member3): private . get () 200 Member2 can\u2019t read the state. All nodes are validating the same blockchain of transactions, with the private transactions containing only a 512-bit hash in place of the transaction data, and only the parties to the private transactions can view and update the state of the private contracts. Use Remix \u00b6 You can connect your nodes to Remix by using the GoQuorum Plugin . Follow the instructions for activating the remix plugin in Getting Started , using the GoQuorum and Tessera URLs in the Private transactions section. Use Cakeshop \u00b6 Cakeshop allows you to perform transactions directly using the UI. Open http://localhost:8999 in your browser. Select the Contracts tab and Deploy the contract registry. Go to the Sandbox , select the SimpleStorage sample contract from the Contract Library, and deploy with Private For set to the second node\u2019s public key ( QfeDAys9MPDs2XHExtc84jKGHxZg/aj52DTh0vtA3Xc= ). Return to the main Cakeshop page, go to the Contracts tab again, and you should be able to see the contract you just deployed. Interact with it from there, and switch between nodes using the dropdown in the top right corner of the page. Create a transaction using MetaMask \u00b6 You can use MetaMask to send a transaction on your private network. Open MetaMask and connect it to your private network RPC endpoint by selecting Localhost 8545 in the network list. Choose one of the following test accounts and import it into MetaMask by copying the corresponding private key . Security warning Do not use the test accounts on Ethereum mainnet or any production network. The following accounts are test accounts and their private keys are publicly visible in this documentation and in publicly available source code. They are not secure and everyone can use them. Using test accounts on Ethereum mainnet and production networks can lead to loss of funds and identity fraud. In this documentation, we only provide test accounts for ease of testing and learning purposes; never use them for other purposes. Always secure your Ethereum mainnet and any production account properly. See for instance MyCrypto \u201cProtecting Yourself and Your Funds\u201d guide . Test Account 1 (address 0xfe3b557e8fb62b89f4916b721be55ceb828dbd73 ) Private key to copy : 0x8f2a55949038a9610f50fb23b5883af3b4ecb3c3bb792cbcefbd1542c692be63 Initial balance : 200 Eth (200000000000000000000 Wei) Test Account 2 (address 0x627306090abaB3A6e1400e9345bC60c78a8BEf57 ) Private key to copy : 0xc87509a1c067bbde78beb793e6fa76530b6382a4c0241e5e4a9ec0a0f44dc0d3 Initial balance : 90000 Eth (90000000000000000000000 Wei) Test Account 3 (address 0xf17f52151EbEF6C7334FAD080c5704D77216b732 ) Private key to copy : 0xae6ae8e5ccbfb04590405997ee2d52d2b330726137b875053c36d94e974d162f Initial balance : 90000 Eth (90000000000000000000000 Wei) After importing an existing test account, create another test account from scratch to use as the recipient for a test Ether transaction. In MetaMask, select the new test account and copy its address . In the Block Explorer , search for the new test account by clicking on the and pasting the test account address into the search box. The new test account displays with a zero balance. Send test Ether from the first test account (containing test Ether) to the new test account (which has a zero balance). Tip You can use a zero gas price here as this private test network is a free gas network, but the maximum amount of gas that can be used (the gas limit) for a value transaction must be at least 21000. Refresh the Block Explorer page in your browser displaying the target test account. The updated balance reflects the transaction completed using MetaMask. Smart contract and dapp usage \u00b6 You can use a demo dapp called Pet Shop, provided by Truffle . The dapp runs a local website using Docker, and uses smart contracts deployed on the network. The directory created by quorum-dev-quickstart includes a dapps directory with a pet-shop subdirectory, which contains the source code for the dapp, including the smart contracts, website, and configurations to run this tutorial. With the blockchain running and MetaMask connected to Localhost 8545 , run the following command to start the Pet Shop dapp: cd dapps/pet-shop ./run_dapp.sh The script: Installs the dapp Node dependencies (you may see some warnings here, but it will not prevent the dapp from running).

When you click on Adopt , a MetaMask window will pop up and request your permissions to continue with the transaction. After the transaction is complete and successful, the status of the pet you adopted will show Success . You can also search for the transaction and view its details in the Block Explorer . The MetaMask UI also keeps a record of the transaction. Stop and restart the private network without removing containers \u00b6 To shut down the private network without deleting the containers: Linux/MacOS ./stop.sh This command stops the containers related to the services specified in the docker-compose.yml file. To restart the private network: Linux/MacOS ./resume.sh Stop the private network and remove containers \u00b6 To shut down the private network and delete all containers and images created from running the sample network and the Pet Shop dapp: Linux/MacOS ./remove.sh Add a new node to the network \u00b6 New nodes joining an existing network require the following: The same genesis file used by all other nodes on the running network. A list of nodes to connect to; this is done by specifying bootnodes , or by providing a list of static nodes . A node key pair and optionally an account. If the running network is using permissions, then you need to add the new node\u2019s enode details to the permissions file used by existing nodes, or update the onchain permissioning contract. The following steps describe the process to add a new node to the Quorum Dev Quickstart. 1. Create the node key files \u00b6 Create a node key pair and account for a new node, by running the following script: cd ./extra npm install node generate_node_keys.js --password \"Password\" Note The --password parameter is optional. 2. Create new node directory \u00b6 In the config/nodes directory, create a subdirectory for the new node (for example, newnode ), and move the nodekey , nodekey.pub , address and accountkey files from the previous step into this directory. 3. Update docker-compose \u00b6 Add an entry for the new node into the docker-compose file: newnode : << : *quorum-def container_name : newnode ports : - 18545:8545/tcp - 18546:8546/tcp - 30303 - 9545 environment : - NODE_ID=41 - PRIVATE_CONFIG=ignore volumes : - ./config/goquorum:/quorum - ./config/nodes/newnode:/config/keys - ./logs/quorum:/var/log/quorum/ networks : quorum-dev-quickstart : ipv4_address : 172.16.239.41 Important Select an IP address and port map that aren\u2019t being used for the other containers. Additionally mount the newly created folder ./config/nodes/newnode to the /config/keys directory of the new node. 4. Update files with the enode address \u00b6 Add the new node\u2019s enode address to the static nodes file and permissions file . The enode uses the format enode://pubkey@ip_address:30303?discport=0&raftport=53000 . where raftport is only required for the Raft consensus algorithm If the nodekey.pub is 4540ea...9c1d78 and the IP address is 172.16.239.41 , then the enode address would be \"enode://4540ea...9c1d78@172.16.239.41:30303?discport=0&raftport=53000\" , which must be added to both files. 5. Start the network \u00b6 Once complete, start the network up with ./run.sh On a live network the process is the same when using local permissions with the permissioned-nodes.json file. You don\u2019t need to restart the network and subsequent changes to the files are picked up by the servers. When using the smart contract you can either make changes via a dapp or via RPC API calls.","title":"Using the quickstart"},{"location":"tutorials/quorum-dev-quickstart/using-the-quickstart/#use-quorum-developer-quickstart","text":"The Quorum Developer Quickstart uses the GoQuorum Docker image to run a private IBFT network of GoQuorum nodes managed by Docker Compose.

Compiles the contracts. Deploys the contracts to the blockchain. Runs the tests. Builds and runs a Docker image to serve the dapp website. ./run_dapp.sh example output Compiling your contracts... =========================== > Compiling ./contracts/Adoption.sol > Compiling ./contracts/Migrations.sol > Artifacts written to /home/jfernandes/workspace/quorum-dev-quickstart/quorum-test-network/dapps/pet-shop/pet-shop-box/build/contracts > Compiled successfully using: - solc: 0.5.16+commit.9c3226ce.Emscripten.clang Compiling your contracts... =========================== > Everything is up to date, there is nothing to compile.
